"""Test-only harness: n consensus engines on an in-memory network driven by a fake clock.

This module lives under ``tests/`` on purpose. It is not a run mode of the
simulator and is never imported by ``src/``. It replaces the pieces that the
real node gets from other team members (gossip, TCP, ``loop.call_later``) with
tiny deterministic stand-ins, so that the engine's behaviour can be checked
without any network or ``asyncio`` code:

- :class:`FakeClock` is a priority queue of callbacks ordered by
  ``(time, sequence number)``. Nothing depends on real time, so every run of a
  test produces exactly the same sequence of events.
- :class:`Network` creates one :class:`ConsensusEngine` per validator, wires
  ``broadcast`` to "deliver to every other engine after ``latency_ms``" and
  wires ``schedule_timeout`` / ``cancel_timeout`` to the fake clock. A ``drop``
  rule lets a test remove chosen messages (a silent proposer, a node that
  misses prevotes, ...).

Every delivered message goes through ``decode(encode(message))`` so the tests
also prove that everything the engine sends survives the canonical wire format.
